# 🦇 SaintAlucard's Way

*A no-nonsense VS Code extension pack for Salesforce developers who want to code faster, prettier, and smarter.*  

---

### ❓ What is this?  
A **curated collection of VS Code extensions, themes, and settings** I (SaintAlucard) use daily. It bundles tools for:  
- 🚀 **Productivity** (AI helpers, shortcuts, debuggers)  
- 🎨 **Aesthetics** (themes, icons, minimal UI tweaks)  
- ⚡ **Workflow** (git ninjutsu, language packs, automation).  

---

### ❓ Why is this?  
Because **setting up a dev environment shouldn’t take 3 hours**. This pack:  
- Removes the guesswork of choosing extensions  
- Balances speed with visual polish  
- Forces fewer decisions, more coding.
